<h2>CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Throughout this project user requirements were implemented as they changed. For example, initially, the client wanted a list of top destinations, then a slideshow of top destinations, and finally a slideshow of detox destinations. To keep track of these changing requirements, user stories were created. User stories are important because they assign value to each requirement and help keep track of changing requirements.</p>
<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p>I always approach software development focused on client needs and requirements. I hope to use user stories to fragment a complete project and incremental development in future development projects. In a development team, being a good team member means that you do your work, collaborate with your team, and assist others as much as possible. Essentially, to be a good team member in a development team you must contribute to the team to your maximum ability.</p>
